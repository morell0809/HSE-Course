# Variant

## Task

In this task you will implement the [`Variant`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/variant).

`Variant` is a generalization of a **union** type

You should implement following functions:
* [`Get`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/variant/get) - returns the reference to the value by index
* [`Get`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/variant/get) - returns the reference to the value by type `Variant`
* [`operator=`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/variant/operator%3D) - assignment operator
